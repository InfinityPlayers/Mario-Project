## :cactus: About

Welcome to the **Super Mario Project (_Powered by EBANX Infinity Game_)**, this is a project based on the Super Mario World like as you can notice XD.
The main point about this project is to develop our skill building any Front-End project that we want, from a very simple thing to a nice one.

## :cactus: Motivation

Every(_almost_) week at [@EBANX](https://github.com/ebanx), we have a meeting called *Infinity* where our Front-End team discuss subjects about Front-End Development, what we learned and want to share with each other. It's a nice meeting to be update about technologies and more important, to have a great and healthy interation with the team.

In one of these meetings, we discuss about to go more further to improve our skills and we had an agreement to bring a new project, every single month. It can be a _huge_ / _small_ / _simple_ / _nice_ / _great_ project (**just do it**), it's just to be always a better developer. **LET'S ROCK!** :rocket: :fire:


## :cactus: Why Super Mario?

I just picked one character about our game universe and that's it :information_desk_person:. NO, it's because Mario is a normal guy trying new things to go further your goal, to save the Princess.

</p>

If we put this super :cool: analogy in our ~ _Dev Life_ ~, makes total sense. We are normal people, we try new things and we want to go further everyday in our lifes to achieve a goal, as Mario does. We will fail a lot, but we'll win too. It's simple, BUILD TO ACHIEVE.
